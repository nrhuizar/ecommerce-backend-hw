# E-Commerce Backend HW

## Description

The E-Commerce Backend HW was a challenge to successfully build a MySQL database using Sequelize.  We were given the seed data and created models and roots to allow for successful CRUD.  Overall, I enjoyed the challenge of this project but did run into some trouble with using PUT for the Product Route.
